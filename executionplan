1.   Design and Database Setup:
        Define the structure of your database to store employee information, work schedules, and notifications. You can use a database system like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite.
        Set up the necessary tables and relationships in the database to store employee details, work schedules, and notifications.

2.    User Authentication and Login Page:
        Create a login page where employees can enter their credentials (username and password) to access the app.
        Implement user authentication functionality to validate the entered credentials against the stored data in the database.

3.    Work Schedule Display:
        Create a user-friendly interface to display the work schedules. You can use a web framework like Flask or Django to build the user interface.
        Retrieve the relevant schedule data from the database for the logged-in user and present it in a readable format.
        Ensure that the schedule is responsive and mobile-friendly for easy access on mobile devices.

4.    Change Notifications:
        Implement a notification system to inform employees about any changes made to their work schedule.
        Store notifications in the database, associating them with the relevant employee and schedule changes.
        Display notifications prominently to users when they log in or provide an option to view notifications separately.

5.    Work Hour Change Requests:
        Create a feature that allows employees to request changes to their work hours.
        Implement a form or interface for employees to submit their change requests, specifying the desired date and time.
        Store these change requests in the database for review and processing by management.

6.    Management Interface:
        Build an administrative interface for managers or supervisors to review and manage employee schedules.
        Provide options for approving or rejecting work hour change requests from employees.
        Update the schedules and generate notifications for employees when changes are approved.

7.    Mobile Compatibility:
        Ensure that the app is responsive and optimized for mobile devices by using responsive design techniques.
        Test the app on different mobile devices and browsers to ensure a smooth user experience.

8.    Testing and Deployment:
        Thoroughly test your application to ensure all features work as expected.
        Deploy the app to a hosting provider or an internal server accessible to your employees.


Remember to plan and document your application's architecture, database schema, and API endpoints. 
It's also important to consider security measures, such as encryption, authentication, and authorization, to protect employee data.
